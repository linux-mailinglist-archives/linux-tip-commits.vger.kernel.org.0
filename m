If it's the right thing to do and accepted by the DT folks, then the
changelog should provide a proper explanation for it. The one you
provided just baffles me. Plus the clearing of the flag really needs a
big fat comment.

It still does not make any sense to me.

arm,vexpress-sysreg is a MFD device, so can the ARM people please
explain, why the sched clock part is not just another MFD sub-device or
simply has it's own DT match?

git grep perhaps? And that's pretty much the same problem:

drivers/clocksource/timer-tegra.c:TIMER_OF_DECLARE(tegra20_rtc, "nvidia,tegra20-rtc", tegra20_init_rtc);
drivers/rtc/rtc-tegra.c:        { .compatible = "nvidia,tegra20-rtc", },

Without looking deeper I suspect that these two are not the only ones.

Can the DT folks pretty please comment on this and provide some guidance
how to fix that w/o sprinkling 

    of_node_clear_flag(node, OF_POPULATED);

all over the place?

Thanks,

        tglx
