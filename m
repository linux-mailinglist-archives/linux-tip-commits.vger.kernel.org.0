tools/memory-model/Documentation: Put redefinition of rcu-fence into explanation.txt

This patch updates the Linux Kernel Memory Model's explanation.txt
file to incorporate the introduction of the rcu-order relation and
the redefinition of rcu-fence made by commit 15aa25cbf0cc
("tools/memory-model: Change definition of rcu-fence").

+The rcu-fence relation is a simple extension of rcu-order.  While
+rcu-order only links certain fence events (calls to synchronize_rcu(),
+rcu_read_lock(), or rcu_read_unlock()), rcu-fence links any events

+From the discussion above, we see this implies not only that X

+CPUs.  (Perhaps this fact should lead us to say that rcu-fence isn't
