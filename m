kcsan: Fix misreporting if concurrent races on same address

If there are at least 4 threads racing on the same address, it can
happen that one of the readers may observe another matching reader in
other_info. To avoid locking up, we have to consume 'other_info'
regardless, but skip the report. See the added comment for more details.

+			 *   resulting in a report of write1-write2. This report
+			 *   is valid, however, now read1 populates other_info;
+			 *   read2-read1 is an invalid conflict, yet, no other
+			 *   conflicting access is left. Therefore, we must
+			 *   consume read1's other_info.
+			 *
+			 * Since this case is assumed to be rare, it is
