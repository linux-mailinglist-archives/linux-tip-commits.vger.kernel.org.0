seqlock: Introduce seqcount_latch_t

Latch sequence counters are a multiversion concurrency control mechanism
where the seqcount_t counter even/odd value is used to switch between
two copies of protected data. This allows the seqcount_t read path to
safely interrupt its write side critical section (e.g. from NMIs).

Initially, latch sequence counters were implemented as a single write
function above plain seqcount_t: raw_write_seqcount_latch(). The read
side was expected to use plain seqcount_t raw_read_seqcount().

A specialized latch read function, raw_read_seqcount_latch(), was later
added. It became the standardized way for latch read paths.  Due to the
dependent load, it has one read memory barrier less than the plain
seqcount_t raw_read_seqcount() API.

Only raw_write_seqcount_latch() and raw_read_seqcount_latch() should be
used with latch sequence counters. Having *unique* read and write path
APIs means that latch sequence counters are actually a data type of
their own -- just inappropriately overloading plain seqcount_t.

Introduce seqcount_latch_t. This adds type-safety and ensures that only
the correct latch-safe APIs are to be used.

Not to break bisection, let the latch APIs also accept plain seqcount_t
or seqcount_raw_spinlock_t. After converting all call sites to
seqcount_latch_t, only that new data type will be allowed.

+Latch sequence counters (``seqcount_latch_t``)
+----------------------------------------------
+
+Latch sequence counters are a multiversion concurrency control mechanism
+where the embedded seqcount_t counter even/odd value is used to switch
+between two copies of protected data. This allows the sequence counter
+read path to safely interrupt its own write side critical section.
+
+Use seqcount_latch_t when the write side sections cannot be protected
+from interruption by readers. This is typically the case when the read
+side can be invoked from NMI handlers.
+
+Check `raw_write_seqcount_latch()` for more information.
