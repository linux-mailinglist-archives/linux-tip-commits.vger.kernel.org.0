Documentation/locking/locktypes: Further clarifications and wordsmithing

The documentation of rw_semaphores is wrong as it claims that the non-owner
reader release is not supported by RT. That's just history biased memory
distortion.

Split the 'Owner semantics' section up and add separate sections for
semaphore and rw_semaphore to reflect reality.

Aside of that the following updates are done:

 - Add pseudo code to document the spinlock state preserving mechanism on
   PREEMPT_RT

 - Wordsmith the bitspinlock and lock nesting sections

+=========

+
+Semaphores are often used for both serialization and waiting, but new use

+
+semaphores and PREEMPT_RT
+----------------------------
+
+PREEMPT_RT does not change the semaphore implementation because counting
+semaphores have no concept of owners, thus preventing PREEMPT_RT from
+providing priority inheritance for semaphores.  After all, an unknown
+owner cannot be boosted. As a consequence, blocking on semaphores can

+
+rw_semaphore
+============
+
+rw_semaphore is a multiple readers and single writer lock mechanism.
+
+On non-PREEMPT_RT kernels the implementation is fair, thus preventing

+
+rw_semaphore complies by default with the strict owner semantics, but there
+exist special-purpose interfaces that allow non-owner release for readers.
+These interfaces work independent of the kernel configuration.
+
+rw_semaphore and PREEMPT_RT
+---------------------------
+
+PREEMPT_RT kernels map rw_semaphore to a separate rt_mutex-based
+implementation, thus changing the fairness:
+
+ Because an rw_semaphore writer cannot grant its priority to multiple
+ readers, a preempted low-priority reader will continue holding its lock,
+ thus starving even high-priority writers.  In contrast, because readers
+ can grant their priority to a writer, a preempted low-priority writer will
+ have its priority boosted until it releases the lock, thus preventing that
+ writer from starving readers.

-Owner semantics
-===============
-
-Most lock types in the Linux kernel have strict owner semantics, i.e. the
-context (task) which acquires a lock has to release it.
-
-There are two exceptions:
-
-  - semaphores
-  - rwsems
-
-semaphores have no owner semantics for historical reason, and as such
-trylock and release operations can be called from any context. They are
-often used for both serialization and waiting purposes. That's generally
-discouraged and should be replaced by separate serialization and wait
-mechanisms, such as mutexes and completions.
-
-rwsems have grown interfaces which allow non owner release for special
-purposes. This usage is problematic on PREEMPT_RT because PREEMPT_RT
-substitutes all locking primitives except semaphores with RT-mutex based
-implementations to provide priority inheritance for all lock types except
-the truly spinning ones. Priority inheritance on ownerless locks is
-obviously impossible.
-
-For now the rwsem non-owner release excludes code which utilizes it from
-being used on PREEMPT_RT enabled kernels. In same cases this can be
-mitigated by disabling portions of the code, in other cases the complete
-functionality has to be disabled until a workable solution has been found.
+Lockdep will complain if these constraints are violated, both in
+PREEMPT_RT and otherwise.
