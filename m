dt-bindings: irqchip: Add PRU-ICSS interrupt controller bindings

The Programmable Real-Time Unit and Industrial Communication Subsystem
(PRU-ICSS or simply PRUSS) contains an interrupt controller (INTC) that
can handle various system input events and post interrupts back to the
device-level initiators. The INTC can support up to 64 input events on
most SoCs with individual control configuration and h/w prioritization.
These events are mapped onto 10 output interrupt lines through two levels
of many-to-one mapping support. Different interrupt lines are routed to
the individual PRU cores or to the host CPU or to other PRUSS instances.

The K3 AM65x and J721E SoCs have the next generation of the PRU-ICSS IP,
commonly called ICSSG. The ICSSG interrupt controller on K3 SoCs provide
a higher number of host interrupts (20 vs 10) and can handle an increased
number of input events (160 vs 64) from various SoC interrupt sources.

Add the bindings document for these interrupt controllers on all the
applicable SoCs. It covers the OMAP architecture SoCs - AM33xx, AM437x
and AM57xx; the Keystone 2 architecture based 66AK2G SoC; the Davinci
architecture based OMAPL138 SoCs, and the K3 architecture based AM65x
and J721E SoCs.

+description: |
+  Each PRU-ICSS has a single interrupt controller instance that is common
+  to all the PRU cores. Most interrupt controllers can route 64 input events
+  which are then mapped to 10 possible output interrupts through two levels
+  of mapping. The input events can be triggered by either the PRUs and/or
+  various other PRUSS internal and external peripherals. The first 2 output
+  interrupts (0, 1) are fed exclusively to the internal PRU cores, with the
+  remaining 8 (2 through 9) connected to external interrupt controllers
+  including the MPU and/or other PRUSS instances, DSPs or devices.
+
+  The property "ti,irqs-reserved" is used for denoting the connection
+  differences on the output interrupts 2 through 9. If this property is not
+  defined, it implies that all the PRUSS INTC output interrupts 2 through 9
+  (host_intr0 through host_intr7) are connected exclusively to the Arm interrupt
+  controller.
+
+  The K3 family of SoCs can handle 160 input events that can be mapped to 20
+  different possible output interrupts. The additional output interrupts (10
+  through 19) are connected to new sub-modules within the ICSSG instances.
+
+  This interrupt-controller node should be defined as a child node of the
+  corresponding PRUSS node. The node should be named "interrupt-controller".

+      host_event (target) [cell 3] as the value of the interrupts property in
+      their node.  The system events can be mapped to some output host
+      interrupts through 2 levels of many-to-one mapping i.e. events to channel
+      mapping and channels to host interrupts so through this property entire
+      mapping is provided.

+      SoC. Define this property when any of 8 interrupts should not be handled
+      by Arm interrupt controller.

+              connected to MPU

+              instances.
