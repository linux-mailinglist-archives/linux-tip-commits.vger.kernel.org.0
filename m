Level type interrupts are "resending" in hardware as long as the device
interrupt is still asserted.

The problem are edge interrupts.

    When an edge interrupt is disabled via disable_irq() the core does
    not mask the chip because if the device raises an interrupt not all
    interrupt chips latch that and forward it to the CPU on unmask,
    i.e. some interrupt chips simply ignore an etch when the line is
    masked.

    So when the device raises an edge while the interrupt is disabled
    the core still handles the hardware interrupt and:

      - masks the interrupt line
      - sets the pending bit
      - does not invoke the device handler

    On enable_irq() the pending bit is checked and if set the interrupt
    is tried to be retriggered or resent, but only if it's edge type.
    
    So if the interrupt chip provides a irq_retrigger() callback the
    core uses that and only if this fails or is not available it resorts
    to software "resend" which means queueing it for execution in
    tasklet context.

irq resending on X86 is not really problem free for interrupts
which are directly connect to the local APIC. The only way which is
halfways safe is the hardware retrigger. See

    https://lkml.kernel.org/r/20200306130623.590923677@linutronix.de
    https://lkml.kernel.org/r/20200306130623.684591280@linutronix.de

for the gory details. The GPIO interrupts which hang off behind some
slow bus or are multiplexed in other ways are not affected by this
hardware design induced madness.

As I don't know how many other architectures have trainwrecked interrupt
delivery mechanisms (IA64 definitely does), I'm more than reluctant to
inflict this on the world unconditionally.

Hope that helps.

Thanks,
