efi/x86: Always relocate the kernel for EFI handover entry

Commit

  d5cdf4cfeac9 ("efi/x86: Don't relocate the kernel unless necessary")

tries to avoid relocating the kernel in the EFI stub as far as possible.

However, when systemd-boot is used to boot a unified kernel image [1],
the image is constructed by embedding the bzImage as a .linux section in
a PE executable that contains a small stub loader from systemd that will
call the EFI stub handover entry, together with additional sections and
potentially an initrd. When this image is constructed, by for example
dracut, the initrd is placed after the bzImage without ensuring that at
least init_size bytes are available for the bzImage. If the kernel is
not relocated by the EFI stub, this could result in the compressed
kernel's startup code in head_{32,64}.S overwriting the initrd.

To prevent this, unconditionally relocate the kernel if the EFI stub was
entered via the handover entry point.
