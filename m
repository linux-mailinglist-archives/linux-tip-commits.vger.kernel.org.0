Good. Last time we made it fail they just fixed their stuff.

Why? It's our decision to define which level of toolchain brokeness is
tolerable.

I really want to see a revert which has a proper justification why the
issues of clang are tolerable along with a clear statement when this
fatal error will come back. And 'when' means a date, not 'when clang is
fixed'.
