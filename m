No. Like I said, I prefer fewer cases of these flags being mucked with.

There are some other ways to solve this. Add a new "ignore" flag. That
would be somewhat better as OF_POPULATED is not necessarily static
(overlays!). Another way would be changing 'status' property to
something other than 'okay'.

Having the device in sysfs could be argued to be a feature.

How much memory would we be saving? Is this really the biggest problem
we have for something that's been this way for at least 10 years now.

Possibly. Depends if only the timer uses the clock or all the other
functions use the clock.

If only someone had said the clock should be in DT [1].

Looking at the history, it doesn't look like this got much review and
it would look a bit different if we were starting over. In any case, a
node for just a counter register seems like overkill. I often get
these MFD or system controller bindings piecemeal, so it's hard to
make any intelligent design decisions.

Actually, the fact that sched clock support was added later on without
doing a DT change was probably the main thing this binding got right.

It's not how the binding is split, but that the functions are split
between a non-driver thing and driver things.

If we had 2 proper drivers, we wouldn't be having this conversation.
It's not a problem to have multiple child drivers for a single DT node
when everything is a proper driver. We do that all the time.
