It's an i915 test (so expects i915 running and root access to your
machine, with the intent of breaking your machine), but the cpu
hotplugging could be extracted

https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/drm/igt-gpu-tools/-/blob/master/tests/perf_pmu.c#L1153

since it's basically doing:
	i = 0
	while :; do
		test -e /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu$i/online || break

		echo 0 > /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu$i/online
		sleep .1
		echo 1 > /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu$i/online

		i = $[[ $i + 1 ]]
	done
	dmesg

Possibly running that under perf stat to keep perf_event_open, or
something else that hooks up the perf cpu hotplug callbacks.

Hope that helps,
-Chris
