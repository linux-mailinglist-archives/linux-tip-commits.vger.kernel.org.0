There is preempt_disable() as part of FPU locking since we can't change
the content of the FPU registers (CPU's or within task's state) and get
interrupted by task preemption. With disabled preemption we can't take a
page fault.

We need to load the page from userland which may fault. The context
switch saves _current_ FPU state only if TIF_NEED_FPU_LOAD is cleared.
This needs to happen atomic.

The fast path may fail if stack is not faulted-in (custom stack,
madvise(,, MADV_DONTNEED))

without the fastpath the average case is too slow.
People-complained-about-this-slow. That is why we ended up with the
fastpath in the last revision of the series.

The go people contirbuted a testcase. Maybe I should hack up it up so
that we trigger each path and post since it obviously did not happen.
Boris, do you remember why we did not include their testcase yet?

The glibc test suite.
