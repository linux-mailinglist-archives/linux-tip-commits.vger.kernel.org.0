So there's two typos in the new comments, there are at least two 
misapplied commas, it departs from existing style, and there's a typo 
in the existing comments as well.

Also, before this patch the 'compiler barrier' comment was valid for 
the whole function (there was no branching), but after this patch it 
reads of it was only valid for the legacy IRET-to-self branch.

Which together broke my detector and triggered a bit of compulsive 
bike-shed painting. ;-) See the resulting patch below.

Thanks,

	Ingo

Subject: [PATCH] x86/cpu: Fix typos and improve the comments in sync_core()

- Fix typos.

- Move the compiler barrier comment to the top, because it's valid for the
  whole function, not just the legacy branch.
