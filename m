IMO, commit 4f41fe386a946 should be reverted and be done with it.
There's no way the timer core can know whether a specific node should
be scanned or not. If you really want to avoid a struct device, then
set OF_POPULATED in specific timer drivers. But I'd rather not see
more places mucking with OF_POPULATED. It's really only bus code that
should be touching it.

Is having a struct device really a problem? If we want to save memory
usage, I have some ideas that would save much more than 1 or 2 struct
devices.

The issue is DT nodes and Linux drivers aren't necessarily 1-1. That
would be nice, but hardware is messy and DT doesn't abstract that
away. If we tried to always make things 1-1, then if/when the Linux
driver structure changes we'd have to change the DT. If we decided to
add a node now, we'd still have to support the old DT for backwards
compatibility. We also have to consider the structure for another OS
may be different.

Generally, if I see a node with a compatible only it gets NAKed as
that's a sure sign of someone just trying to bind a driver and not
describing the h/w. We only do MFD sub-devices if those devices
provide or consume other DT resources.
