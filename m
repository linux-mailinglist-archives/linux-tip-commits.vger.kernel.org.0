perf vendor events s390: Add new deflate counters for IBM z15

Add support for new deflate counters:

- Counter 247: cycles CPU spent obtaining access to Deflate unit
- Counter 252: cycles CPU is using Deflate unit
- Counter 264: Increments by one for every DEFLATE CONVERSION CALL
	    instruction executed.
- Counter 265: Increments by one for every DEFLATE CONVERSION CALL
	    instruction executed that ended in Condition Codes
	    0, 1 or 2.

Also adjust the some crypto counter description to latest documentation.
